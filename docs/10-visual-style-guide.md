# Visual Style Guide

## Overall Vibe

Warm, magical, "sunset-in-the-mountains" retreat energy.

Mix of movement + wellness + community with a dreamy, slightly rustic feel.

Visual style feels handcrafted: textured paper, paint strokes, soft gradients, organic edges.

## Color Direction

Primary palette is sunset + earth + forest:

- **Sunset Gold** (warm amber/yellow)
- **Terracotta** (burnt orange / clay)
- **Forest Green** (deep natural green)
- **Smoky Lavender** (muted purple/grey)
- **Sand Beige** (warm neutral base)

### Usage
- Use gentle gradients (gold → terracotta, green → deeper green)
- Avoid harsh neon or cold tones
- Backgrounds should often sit on warm beige / parchment rather than pure white

## Textures & Shapes

- Use paper grain / canvas grain textures across sections (subtle, not noisy)
- Accent elements like buttons, labels, or headings can sit on paint-brush swashes (rough edges, slightly uneven)
- Rounded "badge" shapes for feature/pillar highlights (soft circles/medallions)
- Overall layout should feel organic, not overly geometric

## Typography

Two-font system:

1. **Script font** - A flowing script for the main brand word / hero titles (elegant, airy, slightly whimsical)
2. **Sans-serif** - A clean, readable sans-serif for body copy and UI (modern, open, high legibility)

### Hierarchy
- Script for hero/brand moments
- Sans-serif everywhere else

## Imagery Style

Photography should be golden hour, warm, high atmosphere:

- Aerial silks / flow arts silhouettes at sunset
- Sauna / ice bath / pool moments with warm light
- Community circles, firelight gatherings, smiling people
- Mountains / nature framing

Prefer real, candid energy + motion blur / movement, not sterile posed studio shots.

## UI / Layout Cues

- Use a hero section with a large warm image + logo lockup
- Feature pillars shown as icon badges:
  - Movement & Flow
  - Wellness & Restore
  - Community & Events
  - Nature & Escape
- Section dividers can be textured bands or brush-stroke panels
- Calls-to-action should feel like "painted labels" with subtle gradient + texture

## Brand Tone in Microcopy

Warm, inviting, poetic but clear.

**Key words**: flow, restore, gather, magic, sunset, ritual, community

## Textures

Texture assets are located in `/public/assets/textures/`

- Files are black textures on white backgrounds
- Use luma keying / blend modes to composite (multiply blend or use as alpha masks)
- Apply subtly across sections for paper/canvas feel
