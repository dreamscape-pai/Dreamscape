# Scheduling & Operations

## Current admin workflow
- Admins use Google Calendar as the scheduling source
- Then they use Canva to replicate the schedule into an image for Instagram

## Desired workflow
- One source of truth for scheduling
- The website displays the schedule directly from this source
- The social media team can export an image OR screenshot a high-quality schedule view from the site
- Ideally: a dedicated "export schedule to image" feature for weekly schedule graphics
