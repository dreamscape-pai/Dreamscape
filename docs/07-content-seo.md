# Content & SEO

SEO goals:
- Rank for venue-related searches in Pai / Northern Thailand
- Clearly explain what Dreamscape is and what happens there
- Encourage membership signups and bookings

Required pages (MVP):
- Home (with intro + links to schedule + spaces)
- What is this place (story, ethos, offerings)
- What’s happening (venue-wide schedule)
- Spaces index + detail pages (each space has description + photos placeholders + schedule)
- Memberships (benefits, pricing, CTA)
- Cafe (menu structure + offerings)
- Contact / Booking requests
- Past events (gallery of previous festivals/parties/shows)

Structured data:
- Use event schema for event pages/listings (if implementing individual event pages in MVP)

Social sharing:
- Good OpenGraph images (even placeholders initially)
- Exportable weekly schedule image is useful for Instagram
